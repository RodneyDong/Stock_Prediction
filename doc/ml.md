Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying instead on patterns and inference from data. Here are the key components and concepts:

1. **Definition**: Machine learning is the process by which computers use data to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform those tasks.

2. **Types of Machine Learning**:
   - **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
     - Examples: Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, and the goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
     - Examples: Clustering (like k-means), dimensionality reduction (like PCA), anomaly detection.
   - **Semi-supervised Learning**: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, and aiming to maximize cumulative reward.
     - Examples: Q-learning, deep Q networks (DQNs).

3. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Features**: Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data.
   - **Labels**: The outcomes or target variables in supervised learning.
   - **Model**: A mathematical representation of the learning process.
   - **Training**: The process of fitting a model to a dataset.
   - **Validation**: Assessing the model's performance on a separate dataset during training to tune hyperparameters.
   - **Testing**: Evaluating the model's performance on a new, unseen dataset after training is complete.

4. **Applications**: 
   - Image and speech recognition.
   - Natural language processing (NLP).
   - Recommender systems.
   - Autonomous vehicles.
   - Healthcare diagnostics.
   - Financial modeling and trading.

Machine learning is integral to many modern technologies, enabling systems to adapt, improve, and make intelligent decisions based on data.
